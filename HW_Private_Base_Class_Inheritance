// Problem :- Accessing Private members of class Base by inheriting as a Private in the Derived Class


class base
{
  
  int p;
  
  public:
  int j,k;
  
  void setp(int x)
  {
    p=x;
  }
  
  int getp()
  {
    return p;
  }
  
};

//Derived Class and inherits Base class Private 

class derived : private base
{
  base::j; // making j public
  base::setp; // make seti() public
  base::getp; //make geti() publlic
  base::p; // illegal accessing i 
  int a: 
};

int main()
  {
      derived ob;
      ob.p=10; // error because i is private in derived
      ob.j=20; 
      ob.k=30; // error because k is private in derived
      ob.a=40; 
      
      ob.setp(10); // accessing private member i through seti() 
      
      cout<< ob.getp() << " "<< ob.j <<" "<<ob.a;  // accessing private member i through geti() 
      
      return 0;
      
  }
